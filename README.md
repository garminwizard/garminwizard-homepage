# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

# Garmin products database

Use a C# console app to download the Garmin products and specifications. The source code is in the [Garmin repository](https://github.com/garminwizard/garmin). There, you will find instructions on how to create a products.db sqlite3 file that contains all the products and specification for all the Garmin watches.

# Sqlite3 WASM (Web Assembly)
While in the root directory of Docusaurus, install the sqlite3 WASM plugin with npm install. NB!

`npm install sql.js`

Then copy the `sql-wasm.js` and `sql-wasm.wasm` files from the `node_modules/sql.js/dist` to the `static/garmin` directory.

# Garmin wizard script

The code for the Garmin wizard is in the `static/garmin/garminscript.js`file. And the styles necessary are in the ´static/garmin/garminstyles.css` file.

# Load the wizard

Docusaurus loads content asynchrounously. This means we cannot run the wizard before the page is ready. To obtain this we must plugin to the Docusaurs [getClientModules lifecycle](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugin-methods/lifecycle-apis#getClientModules). 

The plugin is defined in the `index.js` file inside the `garmin-plugin-script` directory. It specifies that it should load the client module `garminrouteupdates.js` which is also in the `garmin-plugin-script` directory.

When you access the `garminwizard.md` file, `onRouteDidUpdate` in `garminrouteupdates.js` will call the  `startGarminWizard` method defined in `garminscript.js`.
